         <h2>Alma 37:13</h2>
         <p>O remember, remember, my son Helaman, how strict are the commandments of God. And he said: If ye will keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the landâ€”but if ye keep not his commandments ye shall be cut off from his presence.</p>

         <h2>1 Nefi 3:7</h2>
         <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>
